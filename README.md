## Problem Statement:
With rideshare applications on the rise, mobile platforms are starting to replace common public transportation solutions.  However, there is a huge problem for long distance transportation options that remains unsolved by such mobile applications.  There lacks an effective platform to provide a process for both riders and drivers to efficiently arrange long-distance rideshares on college campuses.  Currently the only solution is for students to create postings within un-moderated university pages on Facebook.

There are a few issues with this solution:
You could be scrolling through for quite a long time trying to find a ride that is going to your destination because there is a lack of sorting and filtering
There lacks a unified format for drivers and riders to create requests within the group.
It is difficult to look back at your own post history.
This application is not made specifically for ride sharing, so there is normally users that post irrelevant posts.
There is no set format to say when you are leaving or where you are going, so as a user you have to read through each individual post.


## Objective:
Our goal for this project is to develop a mobile application that gives college students a unified platform for rideshare services. This service will allow for users to easily view all posts, and filter the posts for ease of use. Users will also be able to create their own posts for other users to see. The goal of this implementation is to speed up the time it takes to both create posts, and find posts that are useful to the user.

## Future:
We would like to implement a messaging system between users inside the app.  This feature would allow users to request a spot on the ride, and allow a Driver to accept a user on their ride.

We would also like to allow a user a give ratings to people that have provided a rideshare for them, which will  make users feel much more secure about requesting rides from drivers, and make the drivers treat riders well since they know their rating will be affected otherwise.  In terms of ratings, drivers should also be able to give users bad ratings if they bail on a ride last minute (which happens quite often in UCSB).

Ultimately, we will also implement a mapview.  Though we decided that it would be clutter our application, such functionality will prove very useful for riders that are seeking a particular destination when coupled with a search feature.
